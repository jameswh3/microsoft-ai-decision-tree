## "Agent Framework" Terminology Clarification

The term "agent framework" refers to two distinct technologies:

**1. Microsoft Agent Framework (Orchestration SDK)**  
Open-source library for workflow-based orchestration. Public Preview. Use for: Executor/Edge workflows, checkpointing, M365 Agents SDK integration.

**2. Azure AI Agent Service (Managed PaaS)**  
Managed service for agent orchestration within Azure AI Foundry. GA. Use for: Managed infrastructure, Azure-hosted agents, scalable runtime.

**Quick Decision:**
- M365 productivity agents → M365 Agents SDK + Agent Framework
- Azure-hosted agents → Azure AI Foundry + AI Agent Service  
- Bot Framework migration → M365 Agents SDK
- Workflow orchestration + checkpointing → Agent Framework
