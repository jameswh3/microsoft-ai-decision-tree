## Scenario 1: HR Knowledge Base Bot

### Business Context

Employees need instant answers to HR questions (policies, benefits, PTO) without waiting for HR staff responses. HR team maintains documentation in SharePoint.

### Key Requirements

- Access company HR policies and procedures
- Available in Microsoft Teams (where employees work)
- Stay within M365 trust boundary (sensitive HR data)
- No coding resources available (HR team manages)
- Quick time to production (weeks not months)

### Recommended Technologies

**Primary Solution:** Copilot Studio + Graph Connectors

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Agent Platform** | Copilot Studio | Low-code agent builder, M365 integration |
| **Knowledge Source** | Graph Connectors | Index SharePoint HR site into Microsoft Graph |
| **Deployment** | M365 Copilot | Appears in Teams, Outlook, M365 apps |

**Why This Stack:**
- Copilot Studio: HR team can build/maintain without developers
- Graph Connectors: Directly indexes existing SharePoint content
- M365 Copilot deployment: Employees access in familiar apps
- M365 trust boundary: Data never leaves M365 tenant

### Implementation Steps

1. **Prepare Knowledge Base** (1-2 days)
   - Audit SharePoint HR site for accuracy and completeness
   - Ensure consistent document structure
   - Add metadata for better searchability

2. **Configure Graph Connector** (1 day)
   - Use SharePoint connector (built-in)
   - Configure indexing scope (specific site/library)
   - Test search results in M365 search

3. **Build Copilot Studio Agent** (2-3 days)
   - Create new agent with "Employee Support" template
   - Configure generative answers with SharePoint as source
   - Add specific topics for common questions
   - Set up fallback to escalate to HR

4. **Test & Refine** (3-5 days)
   - Test with HR team
   - Pilot with small employee group
   - Review analytics and refine prompts
   - Add missing topics based on usage

5. **Deploy** (1 day)
   - Publish to M365 Copilot
   - Announce to employees via Teams/email
   - Monitor usage and satisfaction

**Time to Production:** 2-3 weeks  
**Ongoing Maintenance:** HR team updates SharePoint, agent stays current

### Alternative Approaches

**If you have developers:**
- Use M365 Agents SDK with custom orchestration
- More control over conversation flow
- Can add custom integrations (HRIS systems)

**If data is outside SharePoint:**
- Use Azure AI Search with custom indexer
- Connect via BYOK in Copilot Studio
- Supports more data sources

## Scenario 2: Invoice Processing Automation

### Business Context

Accounts Payable team manually processes 500+ supplier invoices per month. Need to extract data (vendor, amount, line items) and update ERP system automatically.

### Key Requirements

- Extract structured data from PDF/image invoices
- Validate against purchase orders
- Route for approval if amount > $10K
- Update ERP system (SAP, Dynamics, etc.)
- Low-code solution for finance team to manage

### Recommended Technologies

**Primary Solution:** AI Builder + Power Automate + Dataverse

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Document Processing** | AI Builder (Invoice Model) | Prebuilt OCR + extraction |
| **Workflow** | Power Automate | Orchestration and approvals |
| **Data Storage** | Dataverse | Temporary invoice data |
| **Integration** | Power Platform Connectors | Connect to ERP |

**Why This Stack:**
- AI Builder invoice model: Prebuilt, high accuracy for invoices
- Power Automate: Visual workflow designer for finance team
- Dataverse: Stores extracted data before ERP update
- 1,400+ connectors: Likely has ERP connector

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up AI Builder Model** (1 day)
   - Activate AI Builder in Power Platform environment
   - Test prebuilt invoice model with sample invoices
   - Verify extraction accuracy (vendor, date, amount, line items)

2. **Create Dataverse Tables** (1 day)
   - Create "Invoice" table (vendor, amount, status, etc.)
   - Create "Invoice Line Item" table (description, quantity, price)
   - Set up relationships

3. **Build Power Automate Flow** (3-5 days)
   - **Trigger:** Email arrives with invoice attachment or SharePoint folder
   - **Action 1:** AI Builder processes invoice
   - **Action 2:** Store extracted data in Dataverse
   - **Action 3:** Validate against PO (if applicable)
   - **Action 4:** If amount > $10K → approval workflow
   - **Action 5:** Update ERP via connector
   - **Action 6:** Notify AP team via Teams

4. **Handle Exceptions** (2-3 days)
   - Build fallback for low-confidence extractions
   - Manual review queue in Power Apps
   - Error handling and retries

5. **Test & Deploy** (1 week)
   - Test with historical invoices
   - Pilot with one supplier
   - Gradually expand to all invoices

**Time to Production:** 3-4 weeks  
**Cost Savings:** 80-90% reduction in manual data entry

### Alternative Approaches

**If invoices are non-standard:**
- Use Azure Document Intelligence custom models
- Train on company-specific invoice formats
- More complex setup, higher accuracy

**If you need multimodal processing:**
- Use Azure AI Content Understanding (Preview)
- Process images, scanned docs, handwritten invoices
- More advanced understanding

## Scenario 3: Customer Support Agent with Enterprise Knowledge

### Business Context

Support team handles 1,000+ tickets per month with repetitive questions. Company knowledge spread across SharePoint, Confluence, Salesforce, and internal databases. Need AI agent to deflect simple questions and assist support agents.

### Key Requirements

- Answer questions from multiple knowledge sources
- Available on company website and Teams
- Escalate complex issues to human agents
- Track customer satisfaction
- Developers available for custom integrations

### Recommended Technologies

**Primary Solution:** Copilot Studio + Azure AI Search (BYOK)

| Component | Technology | Purpose |

| **Agent Platform** | Copilot Studio | Multi-channel agent deployment |
| **Knowledge Retrieval** | Azure AI Search | Unified index across data sources |
| **Deployment** | Web widget + Teams | Customer-facing and internal |
| **Integrations** | Custom actions (Azure Functions) | Ticket creation, CRM lookups |

**Why This Stack:**
- Azure AI Search: Indexes multiple disparate sources (SharePoint, Confluence, databases, etc.)
- Copilot Studio BYOK: Connects to Azure AI Search for advanced RAG
- Multi-channel: Same agent on website and Teams
- Custom actions: Extend with ticket creation, order lookups

### Implementation Steps

1. **Build Azure AI Search Index** (1-2 weeks)
   - Deploy Azure AI Search service
   - Create indexers for each data source (SharePoint, Confluence, SQL)
   - Configure semantic ranking
   - Test retrieval quality

2. **Build Copilot Studio Agent** (1-2 weeks)
   - Create agent with generative answers
   - Configure BYOK to connect Azure AI Search

- Build with M365 Agents SDK or Azure AI Foundry
- Custom evaluation metrics
- More complex deployment

**If budget is limited:**
- Start with Copilot Studio + SharePoint only (no Azure AI Search)
- Expand data sources gradually
