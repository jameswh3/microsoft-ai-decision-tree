# Three-Phase Decision Methodology

This framework integrates Microsoft's [Business-Experience-Technology (BXT) Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/dev/copilot/isv/business-envisioning), [Cloud Adoption Framework AI Strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/ai/strategy), and [M365 Copilot Extensibility Decision Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview).

💡 **See [Visual Framework](visual-framework.md) for workflow diagrams** that illustrate how to apply this framework as an intake process.

---

## Phase 1: Business Impact Assessment (BXT Framework)

Before evaluating technology options, validate the use case through three dimensions. **All three must score medium-high to proceed.**

### 1. Viability (Business)

- ROI beyond general productivity gains?
- Quantifiable cost savings or revenue increase?
- Strategic alignment?
- TCO vs. benefit analysis?

### 2. Desirability (Experience)

- Motivating reason to use over current alternative?
- Solves painful, frequent problem?
- Measurable adoption?
- Natural workflow fit?

### 3. Feasibility (Technology)

- Current team skillsets?
- Hire/train/partner decisions?
- Data accessible & governable?
- Infrastructure and compliance ready?

### Decision Gate

- ❌ **Any dimension scores low** → Revisit use case, defer project, or move to "Research/Incubate" quadrant
- ✅ **All dimensions score medium-high** → Proceed to Phase 2 (Technology Selection)

---

## Phase 2: Technology Groupings (Six Critical Questions)

Apply these questions **sequentially** after passing the BXT assessment. Each question creates **technology groupings** rather than jumping to specific recommendations. The groupings feed into Phase 3 for final selection.

💡 **Important:** These questions create buckets/categories. Final technology selection happens in **Phase 3** based on scenario-specific criteria (time-to-market, complexity, budget, etc.).

---

### Question 1: User Experience Location

**Where will users interact with the AI?**

**Options:**
- **M365 Apps** (Teams, Outlook, Word, SharePoint) with tenant context
- **Custom/Multi-Channel** (Web, Mobile, WhatsApp, SMS, Email)
- **Both** (M365 + External channels)
- **API/Headless** (Backend services, no UI)

**Resulting Groupings:**
- **M365-Centric Technologies**: M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio (M365 channels), Graph Connectors, Declarative Agents
- **Multi-Channel Technologies**: M365 Agents SDK, Copilot Studio (custom channels), Azure AI Foundry, Logic Apps
- **Hybrid**: Copilot Studio (both M365 + custom), M365 Agents SDK + Azure

💡 **Cross-reference:** See [Scenarios](scenarios.md) for scenario-based examples

---

### Question 2: Build Style & Control Level

**What development approach fits your team and requirements?**

**Options:**
- **Low-Code/Visual** (Business users, makers, rapid deployment)
- **Pro-Code** (Full control, custom orchestration)
- **Hybrid** (Low-code start, scale to pro-code)
- **Enterprise Integration** (Workflow automation + AI)

**Resulting Groupings:**
- **Maker-Accessible**: Copilot Studio, AI Builder, Declarative Agents, Power Platform
- **Developer-Required**: M365 Agents SDK, Azure AI Foundry, Agent Framework, Teams AI Library
- **Integration-Focused**: Azure Logic Apps, Power Automate, Copilot Studio Agent Flows
- **Hybrid Options**: Copilot Studio (low-code → pro-code), Azure AI Foundry + Studio

{: .warning }
> **⚠️ Common Misconception: "Low-Code is Only for Makers, Pro-Code is Only for Developers"**
>
> This is **incorrect** and leads to poor technology choices. Here's the reality:
>
> | Term | What It Actually Means | Who Should Use It |
> |------|------------------------|-------------------|
> | **Low-Code** | Less code to write, visual/declarative approach, managed platform (e.g., Copilot Studio, Power Platform) | **Makers AND Developers** — Use when speed matters and custom orchestration isn't needed |
> | **Pro-Code** | Write code in programming languages (C#, Python, JavaScript), full control, custom orchestration | **Developers only** — Use when you need custom logic beyond low-code capabilities |
>
> **✅ Correct Thinking:**
> - **"We have developers, so we CAN use low-code OR pro-code — let the use case decide"**
> - Low-code is faster for simple/moderate complexity (days/weeks vs months)
> - Pro-code gives full control for complex orchestration needs
>
> **❌ Pitfall to Avoid:**
> - **"We have developers, so we MUST use M365 SDK/Azure AI Foundry"**
> - This wastes time building custom solutions when Copilot Studio (low-code) would suffice
> - Developers should choose the **simplest tool that meets requirements**, not the most complex
>
> **Decision Drivers (in priority order):**
> 1. **Use case complexity** — Simple Q&A vs Custom multi-agent workflows?
> 2. **Time to market** — Days/weeks (low-code) vs Months (pro-code)?
> 3. **Control requirements** — Managed governance OK vs Need custom orchestration?
> 4. **Team skills** — Expands options (devs can use both) vs Limits options (makers use low-code only)

### Question 3: Data Grounding Pattern

**How will you ground the AI in organizational knowledge?**

**Options:**
- **M365 Graph** (SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, third-party via connectors)
- **Azure AI Search** (Large-scale vector + hybrid search)
- **Database** (PostgreSQL pgvector, Cosmos DB, operational data)
- **Multiple Sources** (Hybrid RAG patterns)

**Resulting Groupings:**
- **Graph-Based**: M365 Copilot + Graph Connectors, Copilot Studio with M365 data
- **Vector Search (Document-Centric)**: Azure AI Search + Azure AI Foundry, BYOK to Copilot Studio
- **Vector Search (NoSQL/Global)**: Cosmos DB (IVF, HNSW, DiskANN) + Azure AI Foundry
- **Vector Search (Relational)**: PostgreSQL pgvector + Azure AI Foundry
- **Vector Search (Enterprise SQL)**: SQL Server 2025 VECTOR + Azure AI Foundry
- **Hybrid**: Combine Graph + Azure Search + Cosmos DB/PostgreSQL + Custom connectors

{: .note }
> **📋 Ingestion Pipeline Considerations**
>
> Vector search options require an **ingestion pipeline** (chunking + vectorization):
> - **Azure AI Search**: Use [integrated vectorization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization) (indexer + skillset with Text Split + embedding skills)
> - **Azure AI Content Understanding**: Prebuilt analyzers with [built-in chunking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview) for multimodal content (docs, images, audio, video)
> - **External Processing**: Chunk and vectorize outside Azure, then push to vector fields
> - **Graph-Based**: No pipeline needed — Graph Connectors handle ingestion automatically
