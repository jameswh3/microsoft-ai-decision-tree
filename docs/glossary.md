# Glossary

Quick reference for key terms used throughout the Microsoft AI Decision Tree.

---

## A

**Agent**  
An AI system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals.

**Agent Framework**  
Open-source SDK for building AI applications and agents with workflow orchestration capabilities.

## B

**BYOK (Bring Your Own Knowledge)**  
Connecting custom knowledge bases (e.g., Azure AI Search) to agents for advanced RAG scenarios.

**BYOM (Bring Your Own Model)**  
Using custom AI models within Microsoft agent platforms (e.g., importing Azure AI Foundry models into Copilot Studio).

**BXT Framework**  
Business-Experience-Technology framework for evaluating AI use cases across three dimensions: business viability, user desirability, and technical feasibility.

## D

**Declarative Agent**  
Agent defined through configuration (YAML, JSON) rather than code. Simplified development approach for M365 Copilot extensions.

## G

**Graph Connector**  
Integration that indexes external data into Microsoft Graph, making it discoverable by M365 Copilot and other Microsoft 365 services.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**  
Protocol for exposing tools and capabilities to LLMs. Azure Logic Apps can act as MCP servers to expose workflows as AI-callable tools.

## O

**Orchestration**  
Coordination of multiple agents, AI components, or workflows to achieve complex tasks.

## P

**Prompt Flow**  
Visual designer for creating AI application workflows within Azure AI Foundry. Supports evaluations, debugging, and deployment.

## R

**RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**  
Pattern where AI retrieves relevant information from knowledge sources before generating responses. Improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

## S

**Skills/Tools**  
Capabilities an agent can invoke to perform actions (API calls, database queries, calculations, etc.).
